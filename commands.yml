# parameters -> options
# These specify the options for the parameters of the command
# components. If a parameter isn't listed here, it has only one option,
# or the options need to be filled in via other methods (e.g. world
# state).
#
# For example, we assume all parameters above that aren't listed here
# are self-mapping to options. That is, assume there are entires for
# all of them that go:
#
#     move_rel:
#         - move_rel
#     move_abs:
#         - move_abs
#
# etc.
